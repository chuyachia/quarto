  <h2>How to play</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are 4 characteristics each of which comes with 2 variations- color (light or dark), height (tall or short), shape (square or circle) and hollow (hollow or full). This makes up for a total of 16 (4^2) pieces, each with a distinct trait combination.</li>
      <li>The goal of the game is to form a line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) with 4 pieces that share at least one trait in common. For example, 4 pieces that are all short or are all hollow.</li>
      <li>At each round, you can place a piece given to you by the other player on the board and give a piece to the other player.</li>
      <li>When a line of same trait pieces is formed, you should click <em>Quarto!</em> right away in the same round.</li>
      <li>Note that you won't be able to call <em>Quarto!</em> for lines formed in previous rounds.</li>
